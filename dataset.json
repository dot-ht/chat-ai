            "The first indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves came from the observed orbital decay of the Hulse - Taylor binary pulsar, which matched the decay predicted by general relativity as energy is lost to gravitational radiation. In 1993, Russell A. Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr. received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery. The first direct observation of gravitational waves was not made until 2015, when a signal generated by the merger of two black holes was received by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and in Hanford, Washington."

Possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion, or a stellar merger."
